Excellent. For a RAG system, your data must be:

* **Atomic** (small, retrievable chunks)
* **Structured**
* **Semantically rich**
* **Explicit about relationships**
* **Optimized for retrieval queries**
* **Clear on stakeholders, problems, outcomes, modules, and value chains**

Below is a **RAG-optimized, semantically structured version** of your content.
